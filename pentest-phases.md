# Red Team Operations Attack Lifecycle

![Attack Lifecycle](static/attack_lifecycle.png)

### Initial Reconnaissance
The first step in any attack lifecycle is to gather valuable information on the target. In order to find the most efficient way to attack the target, adversaries perform extensive information gathering on targetâ€™s technical and non-technical assets. Data is collected using either active or passive reconnaissance. Active reconnaissance involves any information gathering via techniques that directly interact or communicate with a system belonging to the target organization. Whereas passive reconnaissance involves gathering information using sources the target organization does not own, increasing the difficulty of detecting the reconnaissance activity.
